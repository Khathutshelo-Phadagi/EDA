# EDA
Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) 

## What is EDA?
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.

I will explore EDA via manual and using data analysis tools. 

# 1. Manual

I will use/explore the folowing packages:
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Imbalanced-learn

I will go through the main stages of EDA:
- Understaning the data
- Cleaning the data
- Relationships of variables or features 

# 2. Tools

I will use the following tools for EDA:
- D-Tale
- SweetViz

I will add more data analysis tools later.
